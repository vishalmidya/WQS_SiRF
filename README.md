# How to use *WQS - SiRF* algorithm to find toxicological mimicking interactions 

Here we present a simple workflow with codes in `R` for the `WQS - SiRF` algorithm. We provide simple code snippets and intuitions behind this algorithm and how to use it. 

## Introduction (under progress)

Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) Regression and Repeated Holdout Signed-iterative Random Forest (SiRF) using CHARGE dataset. Details of this combined algorithm are presented in the paper, **Machine learning assisted discovery of synergistic interactions between environmental pesticides, phthalates, phenols, and trace elements in child neurodevelopment**.
