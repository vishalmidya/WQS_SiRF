# WQS_SiRF

We present the codes for the Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) Regression and Repeated holdout Signed-iterative Random Forest (SiRF) using CHARGE dataset. Details of this combined algorithm is presented in the paper, **Machine learning assisted discovery of synergistic interactions between environmental pesticides, phthalates, phenols, and trace elements in child neurodevelopment**.
