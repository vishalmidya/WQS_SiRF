# How to implement the WQS-SiRF algorithm
## Vishal Midya and Chris Gennings

This article presents a step-by-step guide and intuitions to implement the WQS-SiRF algorithm. WQS-SiRF is conducted in two stages to identify microbial cliques associated with the outcome of interest. The first part of this algorithm uses a machine learning-based prediction framework to discover microbial cliques predictive of the outcome. The next stage restores the directionality and is divided into estimating the association between the outcome and the joint-relative abundance of the discovered cliques using a causal inference (or classical association-based) framework. The microbial cliques are searched using repeated hold-out signed-iterated Random Forest (rh-SiRF), where the predictors are relative abundances of the selected taxa. The SiRF (Signed Iterative Random Forest) algorithm combined a state-of-the-art predictive tool called "Iterative Random Forests" with "Random Intersection Trees" to search for microbial cliques predictive of the outcome <sup>1</sup>. On top of the SIRF algorithm, we introduced a repeated hold-out step that randomly partitions the data in training and testing sets for better generalizability.
